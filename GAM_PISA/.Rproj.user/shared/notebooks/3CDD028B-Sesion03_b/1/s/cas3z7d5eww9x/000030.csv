Method: GCV   Optimizer: magic
Smoothing parameter selection converged after 6 iterations.
The RMS GCV score gradient at convergence was 0.001283199 .
The Hessian was positive definite.
Model rank =  20 / 20 

Basis dimension (k) checking results. Low p-value (k-index<1) may
indicate that k is too low, especially if edf is close to k'.
